## Project Features

This IPL Team Manager project offers a wide range of features that help you make smarter decisions when managing a cricket team. Below are some of the key features:

### Player Stats Overview

This feature provides detailed statistical insights into any player from the IPL database, covering their performance across multiple seasons. You can explore a player’s:

- Total runs scored, wickets taken, and matches played.
- Batting and bowling averages.
- Economy rates, strike rates, and consistency over the years.
- In-depth historical stats that allow you to track player performance season-by-season.

The insights are perfect for analyzing a player's overall contribution and determining how they may perform in future games.

### Team Formation

One of the key functionalities is the **team formation** module. You can select players manually or let the program assist you in creating an optimal team. The algorithm uses player stats to suggest the most suitable players for various roles based on the opposition’s strengths and weaknesses. Additionally, you can:

- Form a team of 11 players from the available roster.
- Get suggestions for an ideal team combination based on historical performance.
- Simulate matchups where you can select a team to challenge another and see who comes out on top.

This feature is invaluable when you need to form a team that balances batting and bowling while exploiting weaknesses in the opposing team.

### Player Classification

This feature uses machine learning algorithms to classify players into different roles—batsmen, bowlers, or allrounders. Based on the player’s historical data, including runs, wickets, and economy rates, the algorithm helps you quickly identify the player's primary role in the team. This classification is crucial for selecting a balanced squad.

### Player Comparison

Comparing players is a key decision-making tool in cricket. This feature allows you to:

- Compare two players based on their overall performance metrics.
- Analyze who has been more consistent over the seasons.
- Determine who has the edge in specific match situations, such as high-pressure games or against certain opposition.

You can use this feature to decide between two similarly skilled players when forming your team.

### Match-Winning Insights

In addition to providing historical data, the program offers insights into match-winning strategies. Based on the selected players and opposition, the system suggests how best to structure your team. It looks at the performance of opposing players, identifies key threats, and suggests players who are likely to perform well in specific situations.

### Custom Stats Reports

For the true data enthusiast, this feature generates custom reports on individual players. It allows you to:

- See the most interesting and unusual stats for any player.
- Track patterns in performance, such as how a player performs in the final overs or against specific teams.
- Explore advanced stats such as player form trends, consistency indexes, and outlier performances.

These reports give you a deeper understanding of a player's capabilities and potential, helping you make informed decisions.

## How to Use the Project

Once the project is running, you can start using the various features:

- **Player Stats**: Input a player’s name to view detailed stats, including runs, wickets, and more. This helps in determining a player's form and consistency.
- **Team Formation**: Manually select players for your team or let the program suggest a combination. This feature will guide you in creating a balanced team capable of defeating an opposition.
- **Player Comparison**: Choose two players and compare their key performance indicators. This feature is particularly useful when selecting players for specific roles in your team.
- **Player Classification**: Use this feature to see the program’s classification of a player based on their performance history.

Explore various **statistical insights** provided by the program, which will help you make smarter decisions for your team.
